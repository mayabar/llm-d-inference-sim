# vLLM Simulator

`llm-d-inference-sim` is a lightweight, configurable, and real-time simulator designed to mimic the behavior of vLLM without the need for GPUs or running actual heavy models. It operates as a fully OpenAI-compliant server, allowing developers to test clients, schedulers, and infrastructure using realistic request-response cycles, token streaming, and latency patterns.

## Why is this required?

Running full LLM inference requires significant GPU resources and introduces non-deterministic latency, making it difficult to isolate infrastructure bugs or iterate quickly on control-plane logic. This simulator decouples development from heavy inference, offering a controlled environment to:

- **Accelerate Infrastructure Development**: Test routing, scheduling, and KV cache locality logic without waiting for slow, expensive GPU operations.
- **Ensure Deterministic Testing**: simulate precise token timing and latency to isolate performance regressions and bugs in a way that is impossible with non-deterministic real models.
- **Validate Observability**: Mirror vLLM’s Prometheus metrics to ensure monitoring and alerting systems are functioning correctly before deploying to production.
- **Test Advanced Features**: Safely develop complex logic such as LoRA adapter lifecycles (loading, unloading, and switching) and Disaggregated Prefill integrations.

## How it Works

The simulator is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for vLLM, sitting between your client/infrastructure and the void where the GPU usually resides. It processes requests through a configurable simulation engine that governs what is returned and when it is returned.

For detailed configuraiton definitions see the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)

### Modes of Operation
The simulator decides the content of the response based on two primary modes:

- **Echo Mode** (--mode echo): <br>
Acts as a loopback. The response content mirrors the input (e.g., the last user message in a chat request).
Useful for network throughput testing where content validity is irrelevant.
- **Random Mode** (--mode random): <br>
The default mode. Generates synthetic responses based on requested parameters (like max_tokens).
Utilizes probabilistic histograms to determine response length.
Content is sourced from either a set of pre-defined sentences or a custom dataset (see below).

### Dual Protocol Support
Natively supports both HTTP (OpenAI-compatible) and gRPC (vLLM-compatible) interfaces on the same port, allowing for versatile integration testing across different client architectures. 

For detailed API definitions see the [APIs Guide](docs/api.md).

### Response Generation & Datasets
In Random Mode, the simulator can generate content in two ways:

- **Predefined Text**: By default, it constructs responses by concatenating random sentences from a built-in list until the target token length is met.

- **Real Datasets**: If a dataset is provided (via --dataset-path or --dataset-url), the simulator attempts to match the hash of the incoming prompt to a conversation history in the database.
If a match is found, it returns the stored response.
If no match is found, it falls back to a random response from the dataset or predefined text.<br>
Supports downloading SQLite datasets directly from HuggingFace.

For response generation algorithms details see [Response Generation Guide](docs/response_generation.md).

### Latency Simulation
Unlike simple mock servers that just "sleep" for a fixed time, this simulator models the physics of LLM inference:

- **Time to first token**: Simulates the prefill phase latency, including configurable standard deviation (jitter) for realism.

- **Inter-token latency**: Simulates the decode phase, adding delays between every subsequent token generation.

- **Load Simulation**: The simulator automatically increases latency as the number of concurrent requests becomes higher.

- **Disaggregated Prefill (PD)**: Can simulate KV-cache transfer latency instead of standard TTFT when mimicking Prefill/Decode disaggregation architectures.

### Tokenization
The simulator offers flexible tokenization to balance accuracy vs. performance. The simulator automatically selects between two tokenization modes based on the provided `--model` name:
* **HuggingFace Mode:** Used for real models (e.g., `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`). Downloads actual tokenizers for exact accuracy.
* **Simulated Mode:** Used for dummy/non-existent model names. Uses a fast regex tokenizer for maximum performance with zero startup overhead.

For details on caching, and performance tuning, see the [Tokenization Guide](docs/tokenization.md).

### LoRA Management
Simulates the lifecycle (loading/unloading) of LoRA adapters without occupying actual memory. Reports LoRA related Prometheus metrics.

### KV Cache Simulation
Tracks simulated memory usage and publishes ZMQ events for cache block allocation and eviction.

### Prefill/Decode (P/D)
The configuration for P/D disaggregation deployment can be found in [manifests/disaggregation](manifests/disaggregation).

### Failure Injection
Can randomly inject specific errors (e.g., rate_limit, model_not_found) to test client resilience.

### Deployment Options
The simulator is designed to run either as a standalone binary or within a Kubernetes Pod (e.g., for testing with Kind).

### Observability
The simulator supports a subset of standard vLLM Prometheus metrics.<br>

For detailes see the [Metrics Guide](docs/metrics.md)

## Working with docker image

### Use an existing image
If you do not wish to build the simulator from source, you can use the pre-built container images hosted on the GitHub Container Registry.

Image Repository: [ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim](ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim)

1. Pull the Image
You can pull the latest version of the simulator directly via Docker:

```Bash
docker pull ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim:v0.8.0
```

2. Deployment via Kubernetes<br>
To deploy the simulator in a cluster, update your deployment manifest to point to the official image. An example configuration can be found in [manifests/deployment.yaml](manifests/deployment.yaml).

### Building
To build a Docker image of the vLLM Simulator, run:
```bash
make image-build
```
Please note that the default image tag is `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim:dev`. <br>

The following environment variables can be used to change the image tag
| Variable | Descriprtion| Default Value|
| --- | --- | --- |
| IMAGE_REGISTRY | Name of the repo | ghcr.io/llm-d |
| IMAGE_TAG_BASE | Image base name | \$(IMAGE_REGISTRY)/llm-d-inference-sim |
| SIM_TAG | Image tag | dev |
| IMG | The full image specification | \$(IMAGE_TAG_BASE):\$(SIM_TAG) |

## Standalone testing

### Building
To build the vLLM simulator to run locally as an executable, run:
```bash
make build
```

### Running

To run the vLLM simulator in a standalone test environment with real model:

1. Run the UDS tokenizer, see details [here](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-kv-cache/tree/main/services/uds_tokenizer).<br>
   a. Clone the kv-cache project
      ```bash
      git clone git@github.com:llm-d/llm-d-kv-cache.git
      ```
   b. Create and activate a python virtual environment
      ```bash
      python -m venv <virt env folder>
      source <virt env folder>/bin/activate
      ```
   c. Navigate to 'llm-d-kv-cache/services/uds_tokenizer'
      ```bash
      cd llm-d-kv-cache/services/uds_tokenizer
      ```
   d. Install the requirements
      ```bash
      pip install -e .
      ```
   e. Run the UDS tokenizer
      ```bash
      python ./run_grpc_server.py
      ```
2. Start the simulator:
```bash
./bin/llm-d-inference-sim --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --port 8000
```
**Note:** If the model is not a real model, there is no need to run the UDS tokenizer.

## Testing locally
### Prerequisites

Set these environment variables before running tests:

```bash
export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://${HOME}/.colima/default/docker.sock"
```
Note:

- `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true` disables Testcontainers' resource cleanup daemon (recommended for local testing).

- `DOCKER_HOST` should point to your Docker socket:

| Provider                           | Docker Host Path |
|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Colima** (macOS)                 | `unix://${HOME}/.colima/default/docker.sock` |
| **Docker Desktop** (macOS/Windows) | `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` |
| **Linux**                          | `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` (default, may omit `DOCKER_HOST`) |


Verify socket accessibility with docker info. Adjust DOCKER_HOST based on your Docker provider.

### Running Tests
```bash
make test
```


## Testing on Kind
